简述：`MySQL 5.7.21-1` 原始配置文件 `my.cnf`，为以后查询方便特此记录

MySQL 安装后的一些注意点

1：安装后先设置字符编码。如果一个库（`eg:DB1`）在使用期间改变了 `my.cnf` 的字符编码配置，此时 DB1 的原有的字符串编码不受影响，如果再新建一个 `DB`2 库，则 `DB2` 使用心得字符编码。

# The MySQL database server configuration file.
#
# You can copy this to one of:
# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to set global options,
# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
#
# For explanations see
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html
