<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Welcome to Weiou ("Weiou," "we," "us" or
"our"). Weiou provides a simple and fun way for you to share media
through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo and share! Or choose to
play a hide & seek game, or add comments, if you like.</p>

<p>* OurPrivacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect,
use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web
site, and any software provided on or in connection with Weiou services
(collectively, the "<b>Service</b>"), and your choices about the
collection and use of your information.</p>

<p>* By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for
you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<b>User
Content</b>"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This
means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User
Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can
be found at <a href="http://weiou.com/about/terms_cn.html">http://weiou.com/about/terms_cn.html</a>).</p>

<p>* Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<b>Users</b>").</p>

<h2><a name=section1></a>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>

<h3>Information you provide us directly:</h3>

<p>* Your phone number, username and password when you register for a Weiou account.</p>

<p>* Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name,
picture, phone number, and email address). This information allows us to help
you or others be "found" on Weiou.</p>

<p>* User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>

<p>* Communications between you and Weiou. For example, we may send you Service-related
notifications (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the
Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of
Service-related e-mails.</p>

<h3>Finding your friends on Weiou:</h3>

<p>* If you choose, you can use our "Add friends" feature to locate other people
with Weiou accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party
social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Weiou.</p>

<p>* If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then
Weiou will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone
associated with your contact is using Weiou.</p>

<p>* If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site,
then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you
understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be
governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>* If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on
Weiou then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our
Service.</p>

<p>* <b>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</b>
If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our "Invite
friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list
on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You
understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to
communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming
directly from your personal account, Weiou does not have access to or control
this communication.</p>

<h3>Analytics information:</h3>

<p>* We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for
the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our
Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that
assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics
information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot
reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>

<h3>Cookies and similar technologies:</h3>

<p>* When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels,
web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Weiou
and provide features to you.</p>

<p>* We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices,
which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>

<p>* More information is available in our <a href="https://weiou.com/legal/cookies/">
 About Cookies</a> section</p>

<h3>Log file information:</h3>

<p>* Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a
request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when
the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>

<p>* When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")
address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and
how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages
viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information
from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened
and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more
accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

<h3>Device identifiers:</h3>

<p>* When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may
access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or
more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or
similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which
uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in
connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the
device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by
Weiou.</p>

<p>* A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner
about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide
reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not
function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or
disabled.</p>

<h3>Metadata:</h3>

<p>* Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example,
Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was
collected and how that content is formatted.</p>

<p>* Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag
(e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your
location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more
searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your
photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with
the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your
photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>

<h2><a name=section2></a>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this
Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>

<p>* help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>

<p>* remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next
time you visit the Service;</p>

<p>* provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include
online ads or other forms of marketing</p>

<p>* provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>

<p>* develop and test new products and features</p>

<p>* monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>

<p>* diagnose or fix technology problems</p>

<p>* automatically update the Weiou application on your device Weiou or other Users may run
contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on
the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the
particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>

<h2><a name=section3></a>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Weiou (or the
group of companies of which Weiou is a part) without your consent, except as
noted in this Policy.</p>

<h3>Parties with whom we may share your information:</h3>

<p>* We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to,
information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and
usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of
companies that Weiou is part of, or that become part of that group
("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide,
understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and
Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more
relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about
who can see your photos.</p>

<p>* We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies,
log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party
organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers").
Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably
necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>

<p>* We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party
advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to,
among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
of most interest to you.</p>

<p>* We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with
other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a
way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated
information.</p>

<h3>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</h3>

<p>* Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the
Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled
by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy
settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have
shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by
others.</p>

<p>* Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is
searchable by other Users.</p>

<p>* If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain
viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or
third parties using the Weiou API have copied or saved that information.</p>

<h3>What happens in the event of a change of control:</h3>

<p>* If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Weiou or our assets to
another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger,
acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as
name and email address, User Content and any other information collected
through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will
continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor
the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</h3>

<p>* We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request
(like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief
that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal
requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good
faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects
users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized
standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a
good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and
other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part
of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we
receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended
period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation,
governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of
our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

or any other country in which Weiou, its Affiliates or Service Providers
maintain facilities.</p>

<p>* Weiou, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect
about you, including personal information across borders and from your country

account. However, Weiou cannot ensure the security of any information you
transmit to Weiou or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed,
disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

<p>* Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to
emails between you and Weiou, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be
affected by changes the social media services you connect to Weiou make to
their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or
security measures of any other organization.</p>
